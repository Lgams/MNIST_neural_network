MNIST handwritten digit classifier

This repository contains an end-to-end solution for training and evaluating a neural network on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset comprises 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.

The 'PyTorch_MNIST.py' script trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It includes data preprocessing, a 3-layer model, training with feedback on loss, and final accuracy testing.

The 'Neural_network_visualization.py' script uses the previously trained neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It visualizes the model's predictions by displaying a selection of digit images alongside the actual and predicted labels, allowing for easy comparison and assessment of the model's performance

The repository includes 'MNIST_predicted_vs_actual_labels.png' that demonstrates the model's prediction accuracy. These examples serve as a visual testament to the model's capabilities. The 'Training_process.png' captures the model's training process, showing the loss and accuracy metrics as the training progresses.

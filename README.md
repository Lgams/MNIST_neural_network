MNIST handwritten digit classifier

This repository contains an end-to-end solution for training and evaluating a neural network on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset comprises 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.

The 'PyTorch_MNIST.py' script trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It includes data preprocessing, a 3-layer model, training with feedback on loss, and final accuracy testing.

The 'Nueral_network_visualization.py' script uses the previously trained neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It visualizes the model's predictions by displaying a selection of digit images alongside the actual and predicted labels, allowing for easy comparison and assessment of the model's performance

The repository includes example output images that demonstrate the model's prediction accuracy. These examples serve as a visual testament to the model's capabilities.
